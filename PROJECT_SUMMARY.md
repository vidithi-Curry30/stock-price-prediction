- `src/models/vadps_model.py` - Novel VADPS implementation
- `app.py` - Streamlit dashboard
- `test_arima_garch.py` - Performance validation

## Performance Metrics
- MSFT: 1.46% MAPE, 90.5% CI coverage
- AAPL: 1.79% MAPE, 85.7% CI coverage
- GOOGL: 2.75% MAPE, 85.7% CI coverage

## Usage
```python
from src.predict import make_prediction
result = make_prediction('MSFT')  # Returns high-confidence predictions only
